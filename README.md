# Exp_robotics_lab Assignment2
## INTROCUCTION
Purpose of this repository is to develop the assignment 2 of Experimental Robotics Laboratory. In this assignment robot moves between four position and oracle position in the gazebo simulation. There are markers in that four position, whenever robot place the cluedo link of its arm, the hint is generated. The generated hint is checked for consistency and complete hypothesis. If it is a complete and consistent hypothesis robot moves to the oracle position to check for the solution. If the solution is correct the game ends or otherwise it go to the other points to collect hints.

## SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
In order to better understand the software architecture we can utilise the UML component diagram

![CLUEDO_SIM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82164428/220006145-f78bf9fe-5464-4f06-bde2-0c75e81ae07f.jpg)

The ontology_interface node which receives the solution and hint from the simulation node. The simulation node. Reset planner is the node which gives all the information to the ROSplan kowledge with the help of planner class about the PDDL problem. ROSplan with the aid of PDDL generate a plan and dispatch the plan to the action interface. 

The actions which are defined in the domain of PDDL are go_to_waypoint, movearm, update_ontology and check_consistency. go_to_waypoint sends the goal to reach to the go_to_point node(i.e marker coordinates posistion in the map). go_to_point moves the robot from intial to the goal position. Once it reaches the goal the move_arm node is initiated to move the robotic arm to the marker position.

Ontology_interface update the hints to the ontology when update_request node request. Ontology perform consistency check when the check_consistency node request. With the help of Armor service all the ontology operations are performed with the help of myArmor class. When the solution is found ontology_interface sends the true message to reset planner to stop. Go to point sends and receives the velocity and odometry from gazebo respectively. 

Now to the ros workspace, there are two directories in the workspace, one is a moveit config generated by move it setup assistant and the erl2 directories contains all the necessaty things to simulate and run the simulation.

Moveit_cofig has all the configuration files generated by the moveit setup assistant. And the troubleshooting steps are performed in order to run the simulation and the pacakges. Only to position are defined in the assistant, one is the initial normal position and the other one is to reach the marker position which is target position.
